* WIP: Frontend for the mobile app using React Native

This application is a work in progress app developed using React Native for Android. 
This is an application similar to Google Calendar that lets you create events and share with mobile numbers instead of a mail id.

* Screens:
1. Login Screen
2. Sign Up
3. Forgot Password/Reset Password
4. Mobile Number Verification using OTP
5. Calendar Page
6. Add Event
7. Profile Page

Backend is a django rest framework powered API hosted on `pythonanywhere.com` for development and testing.
